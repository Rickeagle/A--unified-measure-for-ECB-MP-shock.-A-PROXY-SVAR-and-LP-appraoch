The Replication CODES folder includes my codes:

They are the first 3 .m files of the folder.
- File A: Main file
- File B: Derivation of Labor cost
- File C: Correlation with US series

All the Datasets needed to run the code are inside this folder.
All the other .m files are the function needed in order to run the code in the proper way.
